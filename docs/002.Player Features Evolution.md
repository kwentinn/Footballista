# Player feature evolution
All players have features that evolve througout time. Yougest players may evolve quicker than older ones. Each player have their specific theorical evolution curves, that specify the maximum possible evolution.


## The phases of the evolution process
The evolution is a never ending process, the player is always evolving (ie. improving their feature ratings during their young years) until reaching a climax, then they lose ratings. Roughly speaking, it is divided into three phases:
- Phase 1 - ascendent phase: the player improves his feature raings.
- Phase 2 - stagnating phase: the climax is reached, the player cannot improve his skills anymore. He might gain experience though.
- Phase 3 - descendent phase: the player is getting older and loses mainly his physical abilities (stamina, speed).

Each phase has a random duration in years and corresponds to a specific age range (eg. from age 14 to 28 (duration of 14yrs.) => the player will improve its feature ratings by N points).
The phase duration is comprised within a range between 8 to 16yrs.

## Different types of evolution
Each player has a specific evolution curve, which can be one of the following :
- slow evolution : the player keeps evolving, improving their rating slowly.
- fast evolution : the player improves quickly his skills, but reaches the climax faster.
- logarithmic-typed curve : progression is quick at the start, keeping improving slower.
- exponential-typed curve : progression is higher and higher.


## evolution curve
curve is based upon the following formula : y = x^a + b
